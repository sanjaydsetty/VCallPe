# ðŸ“¡ VCallPe â€“ Real-Time Video Conferencing Platform

**VCallPe** is a full-stack video conferencing application designed to demonstrate real-world applications of **computer networking** concepts such as **peer-to-peer communication**, **NAT traversal**, **signaling**, and **real-time media streaming**. Built with the **MERN stack**, the app utilizes **WebRTC** for low-latency audio/video transmission and **Socket.IO** for signaling and chat.

This project showcases how front-end and back-end systems can coordinate to establish secure and efficient real-time communication, making it ideal for academic or professional portfolios focused on **network protocols**, **distributed communication**, or **network-aware applications**.

## ðŸ§  Key Networking Concepts

- **WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication)**  
  Enables browser-to-browser media streaming using peer-to-peer connections. Supports ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment) to traverse NAT/firewalls and connect over STUN/TURN servers.

- **ICE (Interactive Connectivity Establishment)**  
  Helps find the best path for direct communication between peers, even if they are behind NAT devices.

- **STUN/TURN Servers**  
  Used for NAT traversal. STUN helps clients discover their public address, while TURN relays data if direct connection fails.

- **Socket.IO over WebSockets**  
  Used for real-time, event-based signaling and chat. Supports persistent TCP-based communication with fallback handling.

- **Secure Authentication**  
  Login & registration via hashed passwords using **bcrypt**. Sessions managed via JWT tokens (locally stored).

- **RESTful APIs over HTTP**  
  Implements secure APIs using Express.js to handle user actions, showcasing traditional client-server communication.

- **Room-Based Signaling Architecture**  
  Users can create and join custom rooms. Each room manages media signaling independently using sockets.
